            In the past few years, the world has seen a tremendous digital transformation 
            in all its areas. Consequently, the general public needs to be able to acquire 
            an ever-increasing amount of digital literacy and at least 
            some level of proficiency with modern digital tools. 
            While modern software engineering relies heavily on 
            Computer Assisted Software Engineering (CASE) tools and development methodologies 
            (to improve productivity, quality, and efficiency of development teams), 
            those tools remain targeted toward experienced practitioners. 
            Computer science remains taught in a very classical way. 
            At the same time, the rise of artificial intelligence facilitates a variety of tasks; e.g., 
            providing automated support, 
            processing and reviewing documents such as dissertations and other kinds of exercises, 
            or providing predictions of the needs of students.
          </p>
          <p>
            The applications of modern software engineering and artificial intelligence in human-daily life 
            create an opportunity to foster interesting discussions among people 
            from many different communities, including software engineering, education science, 
            artificial intelligence, machine learning, natural language processing, etc. 
            The common lens of how advanced software tools and techniques might be used 
            are a catalyst for a better way to teach various types of students.
          </p>
          <p>
            The primary goal of this workshop is to gather researchers, teachers, 
            and practitioners who use advanced software engineering tools 
            and artificial intelligence techniques on a daily basis in the education field 
            and through a transgenerational and transdisciplinary range of students. 
            The workshop covers three main areas described in the following.
          </p>
          
          <h2 class="top_space" id="innovative-usages-of-software-tools">Innovative usages of software tools</h2>
          <p>
            The first area covered by the workshop is the use or development of innovative software tools 
            to improve the quality of education in both computer and science and other disciplines. 
            This theme includes the advancement in tools designed to help individuals 
            (ranging from children to seniors) acquire better computational thinking skills 
            (such as Scratch and Blockly) and improve their digital literacy. 
            It also covers the development and use of tools designed to support 
            the acquisition of scientific or technical skills 
            (such as visualization tools in various fields of science, etc.).
          </p>
          
          <h2 class="top_space" id="modern-software-engineering-tools-and-methodologies">Modern software engineering tools and methodologies</h2>
          <p>
            The second area targeted by the workshop relates to the adaptation of modern software engineering 
            tools and methodologies to the needs of beginner computer science students or 
            to the context of other academic fields.
            It is common in the industry to use techniques -- such as code versioning, 
            testing, code smells, quality metrics, code review, continuous integration, 
            or tools -- such as Git, SonarQube, BugFinders, Jenkins. 
            However, integrating these techniques and tools in software engineering education 
            is limited or uncommon. 
            Nevertheless, efforts in this direction are beneficial in the educational field.
            For instance, tools such as Hairball or Dr. Scratch have been designed to 
            review the quality of code developed by youth or novice coders. 
            They are essentially static code analysis tools made approachable for younger coders. 
            Recently, these tools have gathered some interest due to their positive impact 
            on the growth of computational thinking in young coders.
          </p>
          <p>
            Similarly, agile development methods have been very popular in the software industry. 
            Many of their founding principles (focus on customers, iterative appropriation 
            of complex artifacts, self-organization of teams, etc.) might be applicable 
            in education. Gathering and discussing feedback on experiences relating to 
            agile in education would be one of the contributions to this area of the workshop.
          </p>
          
          <h2 class="top_space" id="artificial-intelligence-support">Artificial intelligence support</h2>
          <p>
            The third area relates to the support that artificial intelligence 
            can provide educators with innovative and improved pedagogical tools. 
            Contributions to the workshop would include developments in, for example, 
            automatic grading and feedback provided to students through machine learning. 
            Issues addressed in this area relate to how advanced tools, 
            such as automated translation applications or replace-as-you-type spell checkers, 
            can be actively used in education. 
            Additional areas of interest include artificial intelligence techniques 
            designed to help improve the recommendations and support personalized curricula 
            and methods defined to predict the engagement and 
            risks of dropping out of students through machine learning.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through these areas, the workshop aims to achieve convergence 
            between research works focusing on education at varied ranges of target audiences, 
            from junior to senior students and 
            from aspirant computer science specialists to a broader audience. 
            The diverse audiences will generate fruitful conversations and 
            future directions relating to the intricate balancing of teaching technical 
            and specialized topics to audiences that need only a cursory yet accurate overview 
            of the subject (e.g., the need to teach what AI is to social network users).

          <p>           
            The workshop will be a hybrid organization. 
            <!-- Attendees will have the opportunity to access all available content 
            before and after the workshop. --> 
            Each accepted paper will have 10 minutes for presentation. 
            At the end of each presentation session, 
            there will be a time for discussion (5 to 10 minutes per accepted paper).
            <!-- Lightning talk presentations will take place in a hybrid format during the workshop. --> 
            Discussants will be assigned to accepted papers to foster and trigger discussions. 
            A discussant will provide the main contribution and the importance of the paper 
            and offer opinions on the next steps for the authors to expand or improve the contribution. 
            This approach facilitates debates and exchange of ideas, 
            and involves active participation of all members. 
            The discussions take place fact-to-face and/or on Slack, even beyond the workshop.
            
            <!-- Presenters will be invited to submit a video of their work 
            that will be available to attendees before the workshop begins. --> 
            
            <!-- Attendees will have the opportunity to access all available content 
            during the week leading up to the workshop and following 
            the end of the workshop. --> 
            
            <!-- Lightning talk presentations will take 
            place online during the workshop, with online question/answering 
            and timezone mirroring. -->
          </p>
            
          <h2 class="top_space" id="review-process">Review process</h2>
          <p>
            The workshop will follow a single-blind peer review process. 
            Each contribution will be reviewed by at least three members of the program committee.
            Acceptance will be jointly decided with the reviewers, based on the reviews and discussions.
          </p>
          <p>
            As previously published papers have been already reviewed and accepted, 
            they will not be reviewed again for technical content. 
            If needed, the presentation&rsquo;s propositions will be prioritized, based on the content and structure of the sessions.

</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>Over the last several years I have been involved in developing a system aimed at accelerating the acquisition of second language through personalized reading and vocabulary exercises. The system is being used by several hundred learners across languages and contexts. Some of the lessons that we learned during the evolution of the system are that: 1) learners both appreciate and benefit from personalization of content and exercises; 2) learning and progress are challenging to quantify; 3) the usefulness of a tool is limited by the skills of the learner; and 4) some users will even try to fool the tool, especially in the context where they are extrinsically motivated. Besides the lessons learned, I will also outline what I see as promising directions of research for personalized learning systems. <br/> <br/><i>Mircea Lungu is associate professor in computer science at the IT University of Copenhagen. Before coming to Denmark he was assistant professor at the Faculty of Science and Engineering of University of Groningen where he was a member of the SEARCH research group and the Data Science Pioneers group. He was also part time visiting researcher in the SWAT group at CWI in Amsterdam. Before that he was postdoc at the University of Bern in Switzerland, and for six months, visiting researcher at IBM TJ Watson Research Center in New York. He got his PhD working with Michele Lanza and the REVEAL research group at the University of Lugano, in Switzerland.</i></td>
