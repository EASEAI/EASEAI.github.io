    <p>In the past few years, the world has seen a tremendous digital transformation in all of its areas. In consequence, the general public needs to be able to acquire an ever-increasing amount of digital literacy and at least some level of proficiency with modern digital tools. While modern software engineering relies heavily on Computer Assisted Software Engineering (CASE) tools and development methodologies (to improve productivity, quality, and efficiency of development teams), those tools remain targeted towards experienced practitioners and computer science remains taught in a very classical way. In the same time, the rise of artificial intelligence allows more and more easily to provide automated support, automate the processing and review of documents such as dissertations and other kinds of exercises, or to provide predictions of the needs of students.</p>
<p>This context seems to be a perfect opportunity to foster interesting discussions in a workshop that gathers people from many different communities (software engineering, education science, artificial intelligence, machine learning, natural language processing, etc.), through the common lens of how advanced software tools and techniques might be used as a catalyst for a better way to teach various types of students.</p>
<p>The primary goal of this workshop is to gather researchers, teachers, and practitioners who use advanced software engineering tools and artificial intelligence techniques on a daily basis in the education field and through a transgenerational and transdisciplinary range of students. The workshop covers three main areas described in the following.</p>
<h2 id="innovative-usages-of-software-tools">Innovative usages of software tools</h2>
<p>The first area covered by the workshop is the use or development of innovative software tools to improve the quality of education in the fields of both computer and science and other disciplines. This theme includes the advancement in tools designed to help individuals (ranging from children to seniors) acquire better computational thinking skills (such as Scratch and Blockly) and improve their digital literacy. It also covers the development and use of tools designed to support the acquisition of scientific or technical skills (such as visualization tools in various fields of science, etc.).</p>
<h2 id="modern-software-engineering-tools-and-methodologies">Modern software engineering tools and methodologies</h2>
<p>The second area targeted by the workshop relates to the adaptation of modern software engineering tools and methodologies to the needs of beginner computer science students and/or to the context of other academic fields. Indeed, it is common in the industry to either use techniques such as code versioning, testing, code smells, quality metrics, code review, continuous integration, etc. or tools such as Git, SonarQube, BugFinders, Jenkins, etc. However, it is neither common nor trivial to integrate these techniques and tools in software engineering education. Nevertheless, efforts in this direction have been shown to be beneficial in the field of education. For instance, tools such as Hairball or Dr Scratch have been designed to review the quality of code developed by youth or novice coders. They are essentially static code analysis tools made approachable for younger coders. Recently, these tools have gathered some interest due to their positive impact on the growth of computational thinking in young coders.</p>
<p>Similarly, agile development methods have become very popular in the software industry. Many of their founding principles (focus on customers, iterative appropriation of complex artifacts, self-organization of teams, etc.) might be applicable in education. Gathering and discussing feedback of experiences relating to agile in education would be one of the contributions to this area of the workshop.</p>
<h2 id="artificial-intelligence-support">Artificial intelligence support</h2>
<p>The third discussion area of the workshop is related to the support that artificial intelligence might provide to teachers regarding the improvement of pedagogical tools. Contributions to the workshop would include developments in the field of automatic grading and feedback provided to students through machine learning. Issues addressed in this area relate to how advanced tools such as automated translation applications or replace-as-you-type spell checkers might be proactively used in education. It also discusses the use or development of artificial intelligence techniques designed to help improve the recommendations provided to support personalized curricula. And methods defined to predict the engagement and risks of dropping out of students through machine learning.</p>
<p>Through these areas, the workshop aims to achieve convergence between research works focusing on the education of a varied range of target audiences both from younger to senior students and from aspirant computer science specialists to a broader audience. In turn, this blending of different audiences will generate interesting discussions and future directions relating to the intricate balancing of teaching technical and specialized topics to audiences that need only a cursory yet accurate overview of the subject (e.g., the need to teach what AI is to social network users).</p>

<p>This context seems to be a perfect opportunity to foster interesting discussions in a workshop that gathers people from many different communities (software engineering, education science, artificial intelligence, machine learning, natural language processing, etc.), through the common lens of how advanced software tools and techniques might be used as a catalyst for a better way to teach various types of students.</p>
<h2 id="topics-of-interest">Topics of interest</h2>

<h2 id="modalities">Modalities</h2>
<p>The workshop will run in online mode. Presenters will be invited to submit a video of their work that will be available to attendees before the workshop begins. Attendees will have the opportunity to access all available content during the week leading up to the workshop and following the end of the workshop. Lightning talk presentations will take place online during the workshop, with online question/answering and timezone mirroring.</p>
<h2 id="review-process">Review process</h2>
<p>The workshop will follow a single-blind peer review process. Each contribution will be reviewed by at least three members of the program committee. Acceptance will be jointly decided with the reviewers, based on the reviews and discussions.</p>
<p>As previously published papers have been already reviewed and accepted, they will not be reviewed again for technical content. If needed, the presentation&rsquo;s propositions will be prioritized, based on the content and structure of the sessions.</p>

<td>Learning to program is hard! There are so many things to think of: syntax, data structures, problem solving. What if we could make a programming language that grows with you, and becomes stricter and more complex over time?<br/> In this talk Felienne outlines Hedy: her gradual language for programming education, and how it was designed. She will also reflect on what she has learned from trying Hedy with groups of children and form analyzing the first 1.000.000 Hedy programs. <br/> <br/><i>Felienne is associate professor at the Leiden Institute of Advanced Computer Science at Leiden University, where she heads the PERL research group, focused on programming education. She also works at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam one day a week, where she teaches prospective computer science teachers. Felienne is the creator of the Hedy programming language, and was one of the founders of the Joy of Coding conference. She is the author of “The Programmer’s Brain” a book that helps programmers understand how their brains work and how to use it more effectively. In 2021, Felienne was awarded the Dutch Prize for ICT research.</i></td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>Over the last several years I have been involved in developing a system aimed at accelerating the acquisition of second language through personalized reading and vocabulary exercises. The system is being used by several hundred learners across languages and contexts. Some of the lessons that we learned during the evolution of the system are that: 1) learners both appreciate and benefit from personalization of content and exercises; 2) learning and progress are challenging to quantify; 3) the usefulness of a tool is limited by the skills of the learner; and 4) some users will even try to fool the tool, especially in the context where they are extrinsically motivated. Besides the lessons learned, I will also outline what I see as promising directions of research for personalized learning systems. <br/> <br/><i>Mircea Lungu is associate professor in computer science at the IT University of Copenhagen. Before coming to Denmark he was assistant professor at the Faculty of Science and Engineering of University of Groningen where he was a member of the SEARCH research group and the Data Science Pioneers group. He was also part time visiting researcher in the SWAT group at CWI in Amsterdam. Before that he was postdoc at the University of Bern in Switzerland, and for six months, visiting researcher at IBM TJ Watson Research Center in New York. He got his PhD working with Michele Lanza and the REVEAL research group at the University of Lugano, in Switzerland.</i></td>
